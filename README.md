# Summary of GCP Architecture

## Overview
Google Cloud Platform (GCP) provides a comprehensive suite of cloud computing services, offering resources for compute, storage, networking, machine learning, and more. Its architecture is designed for scalability, reliability, and security, catering to various business and technical needs.

## Key Components

### 1. Compute
- **Compute Engine**: Virtual Machines (VMs) for general-purpose and specialized workloads.
- **Kubernetes Engine (GKE)**: Managed Kubernetes for containerized applications.
- **App Engine**: Serverless platform for deploying web apps and APIs.
- **Cloud Functions**: Event-driven, serverless compute for lightweight tasks.

### 2. Storage
- **Cloud Storage**: Object storage for unstructured data.
- **Persistent Disks**: Block storage for VMs.
- **Filestore**: Managed file storage.
- **BigQuery**: Serverless data warehouse for analytics.

### 3. Networking
- **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)**: Isolated network for resources.
- **Cloud Load Balancing**: Distribute traffic across instances.
- **Cloud CDN**: Global content delivery network for faster content access.

### 4. Database
- **Cloud SQL**: Managed SQL databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.).
- **Firestore**: NoSQL document database for web and mobile apps.
- **Bigtable**: Wide-column NoSQL database for large-scale, low-latency applications.

### 5. AI & Machine Learning
- **Vertex AI**: Integrated tools for building and managing ML models.
- **AI APIs**: Pre-trained models for vision, language, and speech tasks.
- **Deep Learning VMs**: Pre-configured environments for ML workloads.

### 6. Identity & Security
- **IAM (Identity and Access Management)**: Fine-grained access control.
- **Cloud Armor**: DDoS protection and security policies.
- **Encryption**: Data is encrypted at rest and in transit.

### 7. Monitoring & Logging
- **Cloud Monitoring**: Metrics and dashboards for resource performance.
- **Cloud Logging**: Centralized log management for troubleshooting.
